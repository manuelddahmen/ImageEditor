## Effects:

# Draw: Do nothing.

# IdentNullProcess. Works reduce image resolution at maxRes*maxRes size

# Hist4Contours2: Works, but all in red component Transform1: makes images with only one or more points. Not good.

# DBScanProcess: works

# LocalExtrema: works

# DericheFilterProcess: immediately returns

            //listProcessClasses.add(DericheFilterProcess.class.newInstance());

Empty code.

# Lines7luckyLinesOutline: immediately returns

Ok

# DiffEnergy: immediately returns

# Lines5colors: immediately returns

# Histogram2: very slow, but works, large flasks of red color

# Histogram3: very slow, but works, large flasks of grey

# TrueHarrisProcess: does nothing, returns immediately

# Classification: returns quickly

# Lines6: does nothing, doesn't return

# ProxyValue: does nothing, doesn't return

# Lines4: does nothing, doesn't return
